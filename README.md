# OCRModel

In Python, many OCR models such as # PyTesseract, # PPOCR, # easyOCR, # MMOCR, # Keras-OCR, etc. are available. However one of the major drawbacks of most of the OCR models is that they either have a good detection model or a good recognition model, but not both. Some models are fast in text recognition but are slower in detection.
